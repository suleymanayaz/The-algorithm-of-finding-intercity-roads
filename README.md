# ✨ The algorithm of finding intercity roads ✨


[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/joemccann/dillinger.svg?branch=master)]()

✨ Traveling between cities using the shortest path, which is similar to the traveling merchant problem, which is a famous problem in mathematics. ✨
## Project Achievements

- Simple to intermediate pointer use
- Write a module that holds methods together
- Obtaining knowledge of sorting and search algorithms

> Example output with all paths to be found between the journey, the shortest longest path, and the path to be traveled through at least 3 neighbors


## Tech

- C programing Language


## Installation

This requires [TDM-GCC 4.9.2](https://sourceforge.net/projects/tdm-gcc/files/TDM-GCC%204.9%20series/4.9.2-tdm-1%20DW2/) 4.9.2 to run.

If you want to filter the image you want, in the [pgmimage.h](/src/pgmimages.h) file:

```sh
 char sourceNode = 'G' /* SourceNode */, destinationNode = 'M';/* Destination Node */
```
You should change the source or destination nodes in the line.
